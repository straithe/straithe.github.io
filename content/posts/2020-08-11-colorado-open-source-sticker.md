## INTERVIEW
Today’s sticker is the Colorado Open Source Hardware Flag sticker from Taylor ([@\_yhetti\_](https://twitter.com/_yhetti_ )) of [Great Scott Gadgets](https://greatscottgadgets.com/contact/). It is a combination of the [Open Source Hardware logo](https://www.oshwa.org/open-source-hardware-logo/) and the flag of Colorado.

Taylor was inspired to make the Colorado Open Source Hardware Flag sticker after seeing a sticker featuring a bicycle gear in the shape of a ‘C’ on a vehicle while he was driving in Denver traffic. This sticker reminded Taylor of both the Open Source Hardware logo and the ‘C’ on the Colorado flag. It was then a simple artistic jump for Taylor to combine the Open Source Hardware Logo and the Colorado flag to create the Colorado Open Source Hardware Flag sticker.

Before designing the Colorado Open Source Hardware Flag sticker, Taylor and [Michael Ossmann](https://twitter.com/michaelossmann) worked together to figure out the laws around using the Colorado flag in artwork. Through their research they found out that [Colorado is quite permissive about how its flag may be used](https://history.denverlibrary.org/news/story-behind-colorados-iconic-state-flag). Other sources they reviewed, such as the [Colorado government website](https://www.colorado.gov/pacific/archives/state-flag), state that the colours of the Colorado flag match the colours of the US Flag, which made it easy for Taylor to choose the correct colours for the sticker.

Taylor designed the sticker himself using [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/). [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/) was Taylor’s first choice of design tool but when he tried to create the sticker in Inkscape he ran into image importing issues that he didn’t have the skills to solve at the time. If Taylor was to create the sticker now he would have stuck with Inkscape.

If you want this sticker, you can send a self-addressed and stamped envelope to Great Scott Gadgets or you can try to find any of the Great Scott Gadgets folk at conferences and ask if they have a sticker. Additionally, you can reach out to me and I will try to find an alternative way to get this sticker in your hands!
