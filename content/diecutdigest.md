## Description
This project is focused on highlighting the creative and artistic skill within the security and technology industries as demonstrated through stickers. In this project I capture sticker stories through written articles, Twitch interviews, YouTube videos, and photography.

## Outcomes
([Blog Posts](../blog)) A few blog posts from interviewees who prefer written interviews rather than video.

([Stream](https://www.twitch.tv/str41the)) A ten week stream in 2020 featuring sticker stories from sticker makers in the community. 

## Contributing
If you are interested in donating stickers to this collection, I'd love to have them! Please send items to the address on my [contact page](../contact/).

If you are interested in being interviewed about a sticker you've created or commissioned, please email me at b@straithe.com.
