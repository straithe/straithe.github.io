## Description
This project is focused on highlighting the creative and artistic skill within the security and technology industries as demonstrated through stickers. In this project I capture sticker stories through written articles, Twitch interviews, YouTube videos, and photography. I am also building a sticker archive to preserve these pieces of art.

## Outcomes
* [Blog posts](../publications) about the history of some stickers.
* [YouTube video interviews](https://www.youtube.com/@diecutdigest804) about the history of some stickers as told by the folks that created them. 

## Contributing
If you are interested in being interviewed about a sticker you've created or commissioned, please email me at b@straithe.com. If you would like to donate stickers to this collection, I'd love to have them! Please send items to the address on my [contact page](../contact/).
