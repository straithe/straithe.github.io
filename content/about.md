> "Brittany is a social robotics, privacy and security, and human-computer interaction researcher rooted in the University of Waterloo's Cryptography, Security, and Privacy Lab. Her usual research pursuits stem from looking at a situation and asking, 'but what happens when we add robots to this?', or 'what would the robots do?'. These questions have led to a research career in which Brittany studies the impacts of robots as social engineers, robot hacking, and IoT systems."
